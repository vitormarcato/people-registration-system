### Why
---

The project purpose is to practice, study and improve knowledge about programming.

The challenge was encoding a CRUD back-end application which is responsible for manipulating data in a relational database.

CRUD is an acronym that refers to the four basic functions that are necessary to implement a persistent storage application: create, read, update and delete.

The project is organized to use a DAO (Data Access Object) class to access the database, with the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern, using Java and PostgreSQL as a relational database.

### Features
